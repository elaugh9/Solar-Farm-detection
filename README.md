# Solar-Farm-detection
In this project, we propose, optimize, and validate a deep learning framework to detect and map solar farms using a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation convolutional neural network applied to satellite imagery. As a final step in the pipeline, we propose a model to estimate the energy generation capacity of the detected solar energy facilities. Objectively, the deep learning model achieved highly competitive performance indicators, including a mean accuracy of 96.87%, and a Jaccard Index (intersection over union of classified pixels) score of 95.5%.
